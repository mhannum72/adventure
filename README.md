This is a simple text adventure that I'm writing for my son.  I'm testing the game logic via node.js.  I would like this to be playable on the
Amazon Echo.

Next up: the cuba maze is going to open the door to a rocket ship which will take us 
to the surface of Saturn .. it's a great stopping point.  I will try to get it running on Alexa
at that point.

I need to create a hint subsystem (these days folks don't like getting stuck on a video game for too long).
